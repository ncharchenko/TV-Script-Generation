# TV-Script-Generation
Udacity Project 3: Generate TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks

## Project Description
For this project, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) and use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to train a model to generate TV scripts using a 3.4 MB dataset of Seinfeld scripts. Due to resource constraints, the generated scripts do not make perfect sense. A cloud-native deployment and training environment would help make more sensible scripts.
